Hi
After SU9, when I turn "Engine Mode Selector" on "TCA Captain Pack Airbus Edition" to the right (Ign/Start), the engine mode selector on Simulator, starts turning to left right left right... as you see in video.
If I turn it to the left (Crank), everything is OK.
How can i solve this problem?
I will be grateful for your help.
